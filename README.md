## Planning

   - **Collaborative Playlists**: Ability to create shared playlists with friends.
   - **Podcast Integration**: Access to music and podcasts in one app without switching.

2. **Duolingo**

   - **Community Features**: Discussion boards and friend competitions to stay motivated.

   - **Cross-Device Syncing**: Seamless updates across devices, making it easy to pick up where I left off.
   - **Team Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration, making it ideal for project work and study groups.

### My App Idea: **Study Together**

**Study Together** is a productivity app with a social motivation twist. The app enables users to set study goals, join live study rooms, and track productivity in real time. Key features include:

- **Pomodoro Timer with Soundscapes and Live Background**: Users can select a timer with different background sounds, such as rain or a coffee shop ambiance, to help maintain focus. Additionally, users can enjoy a calming live background wallpaper (like a moving forest, ocean, or night sky) that changes with each Pomodoro session, creating a more immersive study environment.
- **Virtual Study Rooms**: Users can join or create study rooms where they can work silently together or engage in light chat for questions and encouragement.
- **Progress Tracking and Rewards**: Tracks study hours, goals, and achievements, rewarding users with motivational badges and rewards. This feature helps users stay motivated and feel part of a community, even during solo study sessions.
- **Discussion Boards**: Users can share study tips, ask questions, and discuss topics with other learners in the community, making the app a space for academic and social support.
- **Friendly Competitions**: Users can participate in study challenges and leaderboards, competing with friends or the community to achieve study milestones. This gamified element keeps users motivated and adds a fun, social aspect to studying.
